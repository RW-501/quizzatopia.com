      "questionNumber": 1,
      "question": "A pre-approval letter from a mortgage lender guarantees that you will get a loan to buy a house.",

      "questionType": "Multiple Choice",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "answer": "False",
      "explanation": "A pre-approval letter from a mortgage lender indicates that you are likely to qualify for a loan based on preliminary information. However, it does not guarantee that you will get the loan. The final approval process involves a more detailed evaluation of your financial situation, credit history, and the property itself."

      "questionNumber": 2,
      "question": "The asking price of a house is always negotiable.",

      "questionType": "Multiple Choice",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "answer": "True",
      "explanation": "The asking price of a house is typically set by the seller, but it is not necessarily the final price. Buyers can negotiate with the seller to reach a mutually acceptable price. Factors such as market conditions, property condition, and buyer's bargaining power can influence the negotiation process."

      "questionNumber": 3,
      "question": "A home inspection is optional when buying a house.",

      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "answer": "True",
      "explanation": "A home inspection is not mandatory when buying a house, but it is highly recommended. A home inspection helps identify any potential issues or defects in the property that may affect its value or require costly repairs. It provides buyers with important information to make an informed decision about the purchase."
    },
    {
      "questionNumber": 4,
      "question": "Closing costs include only the down payment on the house.",
      "imageURL": "",
      "questionType": "Multiple Choice",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "answer": "False",
      "explanation": "Closing costs include various fees and expenses associated with the purchase of a house. These can include lender fees, attorney fees, appraisal fees, title search fees, insurance premiums, and more. The down payment is a separate amount paid towards the purchase price of the house."
    },
    {
      "questionNumber": 5,
      "question": "A fixed-rate mortgage has a constant interest rate for the entire loan term.",
      "imageURL": "",
      "questionType": "Multiple Choice",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "answer": "True",
      "explanation": "A fixed-rate mortgage has an interest rate that remains constant throughout the entire loan term, whether it is 15 years, 30 years, or another duration. This provides stability and predictability for the borrower, as the monthly mortgage payments remain the same."

    {
      "questionNumber": 6,
      "question": "Private mortgage insurance (PMI) is required for all types of mortgages.",
      "imageURL": "",
      "questionType": "Multiple Choice",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "answer": "False",
      "explanation": "Private mortgage insurance (PMI) is typically required for conventional mortgages when the down payment is less than 20% of the purchase price. However, it is not required for all types of mortgages. For example, government-backed loans such as FHA loans and VA loans have their own mortgage insurance requirements."

    {
      "questionNumber": 7,
      "question": "The higher the credit score, the lower the interest rate on a mortgage.",

      "questionType": "Multiple Choice",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "answer": "True",
      "explanation": "Generally, a higher credit score indicates a lower credit risk for lenders. Borrowers with higher credit scores are more likely to qualify for lower interest rates on their mortgage loans. A good credit score is an important factor in securing favorable loan terms and potentially saving money over the life of the loan."

      "questionType": "Multiple Choice",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "answer": "False",
      "explanation": "While cash is a common method of paying the down payment, it is not the only option. Down payments can also be made through certified checks, wire transfers, or funds from a verified source such as a gift from a family member. The specific acceptable forms of payment may vary depending on the lender and local regulations."

      "questionType": "Multiple Choice",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "answer": "False",
      "explanation": "Whether buying a house or renting is a better financial decision depends on various factors such as the local housing market, the buyer's financial situation, long-term plans, and personal preferences. Renting can offer flexibility and lower upfront costs, while buying a house can provide equity and potential long-term benefits. It's important to evaluate individual circumstances before making a decision."

      "questionType": "Multiple Choice",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],

Other factors to consider include loan origination fees, discount points, closing costs, loan term, and any special features or terms of the loan. It's important to evaluate the overall cost and terms of the loan to make an informed decision."

      "questionType": "Multiple Choice",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "answer": "False",
      "explanation": "Making an offer at the asking price is not always the best strategy. The offer should be based on factors such as market conditions, the property's condition, comparable sales, and the buyer's budget. In some cases, offering below the asking price may be appropriate, especially if the property has been on the market for a while or there are other negotiation opportunities."

      "question": "A home appraisal determines the market value of the property and is solely for the buyer's benefit.",

      "questionType": "Multiple Choice",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "answer": "False",
      "explanation": "A home appraisal is a professional assessment of the property's market value, conducted by a licensed appraiser. While it provides valuable information for the buyer, it is also a requirement for most mortgage lenders. Lenders use the appraisal to ensure that the property's value supports the loan amount, reducing the risk for both the buyer and the lender."

        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "answer": "False",
      "explanation": "A home warranty and homeowner's insurance are not the same. Homeowner's insurance provides coverage for the structure of the house and its contents against certain perils, such as fire, theft, and natural disasters. On the other hand, a home warranty is a service contract that covers the repair or replacement of major home systems and appliances due to normal wear and tear for a specified period, typically one year."

      ],
      "answer": "True",
      "explanation": "A contingency clause is a provision in a real estate contract that allows the buyer to back out of the deal without incurring a penalty if certain conditions are not met. Common contingencies include home inspection, financing, appraisal, and the sale of the buyer's current home. If any of these contingencies are not satisfied, the buyer can choose to terminate the contract."
